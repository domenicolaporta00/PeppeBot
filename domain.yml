        I am PeppeBot 👨‍🍳, your cooking assistant. Here is exactly what I can do:

           I find the ideal recipe based on your available ingredients, time limit, and diet.
           _Try saying:_ "What can I cook today?" or "Empty fridge"

        3. *Full Course Menu Planner* 🍽️
           I build a complete 5-course menu (from Appetizer to Dessert) based on a specific theme.
           _Try saying:_ "I want a full course meal" or "Suggest a full menu"

        6. *Top Rated Recipes* ⭐
           I show recipes with the highest user ratings.

           I provide detailed nutrients and calories starting from the name of a recipe.

        8. *Cooking Time* ⏱️
           I tell you exactly how many minutes it takes to prepare a specific dish.
           _Try saying:_ "How long does it take to cook Tiramisu?"

      I am a bot 🤖, not a human!
      
      I was developed in *February 2026* by *Domenico, Lorenzo, and Yassir*.
      
      They named me *PeppeBot* in honor of Grandfather Peppe, the original founder of GreenMarket! 🍅

  utter_greenmarket_story:

      Here is our story! 📖

      GreenMarket started in *1965 in Ancona*. It was founded by *Giuseppe 'Peppe' Izzi*, a farmer from Montenero di Bisaccia who moved to the city. He loved fresh and sustainable food! 🍅

      Today, the shop is managed by his grandson *Giuseppe* and his business partner *Domenico La Porta*.

      They created this App to bring quality products directly to your home, offering exclusive discounts and custom shopping lists. 🛒

        Mi dispiace davvero tanto di non essere riuscito a soddisfare le tue richieste! 😔
        Devi sapere che sono ancora un bot in fase di crescita e i miei sviluppatori sono ancora un po' 
        alle prime armi con il codice... ce la stanno mettendo tutta, promesso! 😅
        
        Purtroppo al momento non c'è nessun operatore umano con cui posso farti parlare.

        Mamma mia! 🤌 Did you really just ask an Italian chef about pineapple on pizza? 
        That is not a recipe, it is a culinary crime! 
        🚨 My system is crashing just thinking about it... 
        Please, let's pretend you never asked this.

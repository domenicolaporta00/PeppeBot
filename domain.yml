      I am PeppeBot 👨‍🍳, your cooking assistant. Here is exactly what I can do:

      1. *Empty Fridge Search* 🧊
         I find the ideal recipe based on your ingredients, time, and diet.
         _Try saying:_ "I have chicken and tomatoes" or "Empty fridge"

      2. *Fitness Search* 🥗
         I filter recipes by health parameters like calories, proteins, or sugar.
         _Try saying:_ "Recipes under 500 calories" or "High protein dish"

      3. *Search by Name* 🔎
         I find a specific dish by its name.
         _Try saying:_ "Search for Carbonara"

      4. *Search by Category* 🍰
         I suggest recipes for a specific category (e.g., dessert, vegan).
         _Try saying:_ "I want a dessert" or "Show me vegan recipes"

      5. *Top Rated Recipes* ⭐
         I show recipes with the highest user ratings.
         _Try saying:_ "Show me the best recipes"

      6. *Recipe Details* 📝
         Ask me about *Steps*, *Nutrition*, or *Cooking Time* for a dish.
         _Try saying:_ "How do I cook this?", "Show me calories", or "How long does it take?"

      I am a bot 🤖, not a human!
      
      I was developed in *February 2026* by *Domenico, Lorenzo, and Yassir*.
      
      They named me *PeppeBot* in honor of Grandfather Peppe, the original founder of GreenMarket! 🍅

      Here is our story! 📖

      GreenMarket started in *1965 in Ancona*. It was founded by *Giuseppe 'Peppe' Izzi*, a farmer from Montenero di Bisaccia who moved to the city. He loved fresh and sustainable food! 🍅

      Today, the shop is managed by his grandson *Giuseppe* and his business partner *Domenico La Porta*.

      They created this App to bring quality products directly to your home, offering exclusive discounts and custom shopping lists. 🛒
